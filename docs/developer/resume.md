# Developer docs
In this documentation, you will find how the game works and how to maintain and improve it.
## List of subjects:
### Structure
- [Game structure](https://github.com/CPNV-ES/LiveCoding-Pokedash-Game/blob/master/docs/developer/structure/game.md) : general game structure with p5 and how the elements are handled. 
- [Level structure](https://github.com/CPNV-ES/LiveCoding-Pokedash-Game/blob/master/docs/developer/structure/level.md) : level structure with their elements.

### How To Add Content
- [Resume of naming convention](https://github.com/CPNV-ES/LiveCoding-Pokedash-Game/blob/master/docs/developer/addContent/nameConventions.md) : Short resume about the subject above on the naming conventions in Pokedash. 
- [Add elements](https://github.com/CPNV-ES/LiveCoding-Pokedash-Game/blob/master/docs/developer/addContent/element.md) : add other elements to interact with in the game. 
- [Add new method](https://github.com/CPNV-ES/LiveCoding-Pokedash-Game/blob/master/docs/developer/addContent/method.md) : implement new method to improve the game.  
- [Add new song](https://github.com/CPNV-ES/LiveCoding-Pokedash-Game/blob/master/docs/developer/addContent/song.md) : add new song for game design.
- [Add new template](https://github.com/CPNV-ES/LiveCoding-Pokedash-Game/blob/master/docs/developer/addContent/template.md) : add new template and assets for game design.

## Resume of the project
The goal of the project is to help beginners to code with a funny and playful game. They can choose multiple languages and use the [functions](https://github.com/CPNV-ES/LiveCoding-Pokedash-Game/blob/master/instructions/functions.md) available to create the logic of the game. By this methodology, they will learn variable, types, basic structures and functions of a language while "developping" a funny game.

In our case, we chose to develop a boulderdash game where the user has to interact with each elements, and perform a specific action on them with the functions available.

### Delivered state (03.2019)
The game is functionnable, playable, and has a debug mode to test the fully game with arrow keys (in web navigator console: `game.debugMode = true`).

### Ideas for next features
#### General
- Develop a new game in another technology.
- Add languages.
#### Pokedash Game
- Move all boulders to a specific location/pattern to open the door.
- Add a dangerous environnment so the protagonist can die (moving spikes).
- Add a game editor to easily create new levels.
